** Disclaimer
Use at your own risk.

** Reasoning
The author of this software has thousands of photos scattered across a
dizzying array of devices, and lousy programs keep forgetting where
the One True Library is supposed to live, and what to do with
duplicates, etc. This script is an attempt at writing a
media-synchroniser that does its job well and can be easily setup.

** How it works
_At the moment_, the script recursively traverses a directory and
finds image files in it. It then runs ImageMagick's ~identify~ against
it to guess the creation date and then symbolically links it into a
target library folder.

** Roadmap

- Offer linking or hard-copying;
- Handle duplicates;
- Offer r-syncing;
- Use EXIF data when available, fallback creation date;
- Better help banner;
- Remove the nauseating indirection of code.
- Test suite.

** Example usage
The interface looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ruby main.rb -l /PATH/TO/LIBRARY /PATH/TO/MEDIA
#+END_SRC
